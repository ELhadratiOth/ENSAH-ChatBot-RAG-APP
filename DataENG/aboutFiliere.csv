"Energy Engineering and Renewable Energies","g2er = geer speaciality","Prof. MOHAMED HLIMI","mhlimi@uae.ac.ma","Energy Engineering and Renewable Energies Program Objectives: Nowadays ,to meet the growing energy needs of the population, over 60% of the world's energy production comes from fossil fuels, about 20% from nuclear energy, and the rest from renewable energy sources. However, the use of fossil resources in such proportions raises environmental issues, particularly the emission of CO2 (greenhouse gases) and pollutants (SO2, NOx, CO, CH4, chlorofluorocarbons, solid particles, etc.), as well as price increases and depletion of these resources. The announced problems raise essential questions for the sustainable development of the planet. The first global political decisions were made at the Kyoto summit in 1997, aiming to take precautionary measures to anticipate, prevent, or mitigate the causes of climate change. Simultaneously, the search for new clean and efficient energy production technologies was encouraged and undertaken in several countries. To address the immediate and future needs of our societies, and to effectively and rigorously respond to the challenges of these changes, we must train a new generation of engineers capable of producing, rationally using energy, and managing a healthy and truly sustainable energy environment. The main objective of this program is to train engineers in Energy Engineering and Renewable Energies with versatile training, adapted to the technological evolutions of tomorrow's world, who can intervene in various energy sectors throughout the production and distribution process. The program combines theoretical and technical knowledge with practical work through final-year projects and internships in the industry. This strategy will enable graduates to adapt, respond, and react effectively to the challenges posed by rapid changes in industries, new management practices, increasing competition, technology, and client demands, as well as environmental protection and major risks."
"Water Engineering and Environment","g2e = gee speaciality" ,"Prof. ACHRAF EL KASMI","a.elkasmi@uae.ac.ma","Water Engineering and Environment Program Objectives: The Water Engineering and Environment program was designed considering the needs of the socio-economic fabric regarding skills in water management as well as liquid and solid waste management at the national and regional levels.
